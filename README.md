# TrinitronServis

This is the first website I created and deployed all by myself. It is made for my father's TV repair shop business. It has informational role and I learned a few things about buying domain, hosting a website and deploying it. At first it was designed with pure HTML and CSS, but later I learned Bootstrap myself and did an update to the website.
